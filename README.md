# Save Endo - Java

This is my own Java program for solving the [Save Endo](http://save-endo.cs.uu.nl/) contest from the 10th ICFP Programming Contest.

You can also check out the [Haskell version](https://github.com/Osmose/save-endo-haskell) that I helped work on as part of a Functional Programming course.
